          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>There doesn't appear to be a strong correlation neither between percentage of population that are smokers and poverty 
            rate nor smoking percentage and median age.  However, there does appear to be a negative correlation between smoking 
            percentage and household income, suggesting that perhaps the poorest states have the most smokers.</p>

          <p>There doesn't appear to be a strong correlation between obesity percentage and poverty rate, nor obesity rate versus median age. However,
            there appears to be some correlation between obesity rate and median household income by state, suggesting that the poorest states tend to be the most overweight
            and the wealthiest states tend to be the least obese.
          </p>

          <p>There appears to be a slight positive correlation between the percentage of the population lacking healthcare and the poverty rate which is consistent with what I would expect.
            As before, there doesn't appear to be a strong correlation between the population lacking healthcare and median age, nor healthcare percentage and median household income levels.
